# GoTemplate
Sample of test with Template component of Go 1.6

To make the whole thing work:

Run an instance of SOLR with Docker
https://hub.docker.com/_/solr/

Then run the go project: https://github.com/vgheri/searchAws it's an API rest for docker
 
To conclude run GoTemplate and you will be able to visualize SOLR result through an API rest in a Go Template.
 
 
Remark: Make sure to run docker >= 1.10.3
